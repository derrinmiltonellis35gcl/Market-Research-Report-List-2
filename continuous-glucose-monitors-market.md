<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Continuous Glucose Monitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wearable</li><li>Implantable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) can be categorized into two main types: wearable and implantable devices. Wearable CGMs are worn externally on the skin and continuously monitor glucose levels through a sensor that is inserted into the skin. These devices are convenient and non-invasive, making them popular among diabetes patients. Implantable CGMs, on the other hand, are placed under the skin and provide continuous glucose monitoring without the need for regular sensor changes. This type offers long-term monitoring and may be preferred by some patients for its discreet nature.</p></p>
