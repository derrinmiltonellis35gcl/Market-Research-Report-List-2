<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Aeration Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Surface Aeration</li><li>Subsurface Aeration</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Water aeration systems are used to increase the oxygen levels in water bodies, benefiting aquatic organisms. Surface aeration systems introduce oxygen into the water from above the surface using equipment like fountains or aerators. Subsurface aeration systems, on the other hand, release oxygen from beneath the water's surface using diffusers or air stones. Both types of systems help improve water quality, prevent algae growth, and support fish populations by maintaining healthy oxygen levels in lakes, ponds, and other bodies of water.</p></p>
