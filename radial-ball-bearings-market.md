<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radial Ball Bearings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conrad Type</li><li>Self-Aligning Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radial ball bearings are commonly categorized into two main types: Conrad Type and Self-Aligning Type. Conrad Type bearings have a single row of balls and are designed for high radial loads and moderate axial loads. On the other hand, Self-Aligning Type bearings are able to accommodate misalignment between the shaft and housing, making them suitable for applications where shaft deflection or mounting errors may occur. Both types of bearings play a crucial role in various industrial applications by facilitating smooth and efficient rotation.</p></p>
