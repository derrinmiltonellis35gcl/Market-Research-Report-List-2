<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alarm Rationalization Software Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Standalone Software</li><li>Onsite-Integrated Software</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Alarm rationalization software can be categorized into two main types: standalone software and onsite-integrated software. Standalone software operates independently from other systems and is typically used for specific alarm management purposes. On the other hand, onsite-integrated software is directly integrated into the existing control and monitoring systems at a facility, providing a more comprehensive approach to alarm rationalization. Both types aim to optimize alarm systems and improve operational efficiency by reducing alarm floods and improving overall system performance.</p></p>
