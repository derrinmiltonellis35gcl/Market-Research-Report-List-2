<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ophthalmic Viscoelastic Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cohesive OVDs</li><li>Dispersive OVDs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ophthalmic Viscoelastic Devices are used during eye surgeries to maintain space and protect delicate eye tissues. There are two main types - Cohesive OVDs and Dispersive OVDs. Cohesive OVDs have a high molecular weight and remain as a cohesive gel, providing space maintenance and endothelial protection. Dispersive OVDs have a lower molecular weight and spread out thinly, providing good tissue protection and lubrication. Both types have their own unique characteristics and are used based on surgical requirements.</p></p>
